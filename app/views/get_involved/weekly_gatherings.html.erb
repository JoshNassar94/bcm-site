        <h3>Tuesdays 8:00 - 9:00</h3>
        <p>Gator is an awesome mid-week worship service that you donâ€™t want to miss! We kick off with our very own BCM Band leading us in worship. We then hear a relevant message from Eddie or sometimes a local campus minister. After the service, many students stay to hang out and play games! We even have
